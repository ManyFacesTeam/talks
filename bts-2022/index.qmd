## Founding

* 143 people responded to the [Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1d8_YLegXCQSxsRIcFlS6JcKcXCOPXKOLwjEhFJdr1F8/edit)
* 104 Researchers contributed to the initial [Brainstorming Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6b3am7zwDYXT2-TUR-a85-xG-cdrE8_vz9GICbwAl0/edit#heading=h.apt0qjxvybts)


## Values {.smaller}

### Ethical Research

- Personal data protection
- Avoiding and speaking out against inappropriate use of AI/face recognition
    
### Diversity and Inclusion

- Diversity of region, career stage, discipline, methodology, gender, nationality, etc.
- Don’t just make "the rich get richer"

### Transparency

- Resources and outputs shared as openly as ethics allows
- While not every member can be involved in every decision, the process of decision making should be available to all

## Goals

* Improve methods for image collection, stimulus creation, data collection, and analysis
* Diversify stimulus images, participants, and researchers
* Crowdsource image and data collection

## Organisation

* Non-hierarchical structure
* Still figuring out:
    - membership models
    - membership database
    - website  and communication platforms
* Links
    - Twitter [@ManyFacesTeam](https://twitter.com/ManyFacesTeam)
    - GitHub [ManyFacesTeam](https://github.com/ManyFacesTeam)
