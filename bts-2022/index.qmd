## Founding

[![](../images/first_tweet.png){fig.alt="Tweet screenshot: Big Team Science is growing. I've loved my involvement with @PsySciAcc and think teams like this and @Many_Babies, @BrRepInitiative, @ManyPrimates etc. are the future of science. So I've been wondering if it's time to start ManyFaces."}](https://twitter.com/LisaDeBruine/status/1486807497608466435)

## Challenges

![Facial expressions of emotion: Stimuli and tests (FEEST) (Young et al, 2002)](../images/ekman60.png){fig.alt="Photographs of facial expressions used in the Ekman 60 Faces Test. The leftmost column shows practice (P) stimuli. Columns in the main matrix show the 6 female (F) and 4 male (M) models used in the test, numbered to reflect their position in the Ekman and Friesen (1976) Pictures of Facial Affect series (F2 = second female model in the series, etc.). Rows show facial expressions of anger (A), disgust (D), fear (F), happiness (H), sadness (S), and surprise (U)."}


## Values {.smaller}

### Ethical Research

- Personal data protection
- Avoiding and speaking out against inappropriate use of AI/face recognition
    
### Diversity and Inclusion

- Diversity of region, career stage, discipline, methodology, gender, nationality, etc.
- Don’t just make "the rich get richer"

### Transparency

- Resources and outputs shared as openly as ethics allows
- While not every member can be involved in every decision, the process of decision making should be available to all

## Goals

* Improve methods for image collection, stimulus creation, data collection, and analysis
* Diversify stimulus images, participants, and researchers
* Crowdsource image and data collection

## Organisation

* Non-hierarchical structure
* Still figuring out:
    - membership models
    - membership database
    - website  and communication platforms
* Links
    - Twitter [@ManyFacesTeam](https://twitter.com/ManyFacesTeam)
    - GitHub [ManyFacesTeam](https://github.com/ManyFacesTeam)


## Working Groups

- Any member can propose a Working Group
- Image Collation: create a database of face images and related info
- Stimuli: Develop stimulus protocols
- Reproducible Stimuli: develop [reproducible methods for creating face stimuli](https://debruine.github.io/reprostim/)


## Topics

- Ethics
- Mixed Models
- Social Perception/Attractiveness
